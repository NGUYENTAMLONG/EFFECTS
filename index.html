      <p>
        Firewatch is an adventure game developed by Campo Santo and published by
        the developer in partnership with Panic. The game was released in
        February 2016 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, and PlayStation 4, for
        Xbox One in September 2016, and for Nintendo Switch in December 2018.
        The story follows a fire lookout named Henry in the Shoshone National
        Forest, a year after the Yellowstone fires of 1988. A month after his
        first day at work, strange things begin happening to him and his
        supervisor Delilah, which connects to a conspired mystery that happened
        years ago. Henry interacts with Delilah using a walkie-talkie, with the
        player choosing from dialog options to communicate. His exchanges with
        Delilah inform the process by which their relationship is developed. The
        game was directed by Olly Moss and Sean Vanaman, written by Chris Remo,
        Jake Rodkin, Moss and Vanaman, and produced by Gabe McGill and artist
        Jane Ng.<br />
        <br />
        The game's environment was modelled by Ng, based on a single painting by
        Moss. The design draws inspiration from New Deal advertisements by the
        National Park Service and field research conducted in Yosemite National
        Park. The game received generally positive reviews, earning praise for
        its story, characters, dialogue, and visual style. However, the presence
        of technical issues and the game's ending were both subjects of
        criticism. <br />
        <br />Firewatch won the award for Best 3D Visual Experience at the Unity
        Awards 2016, Best Indie Game at the 2016 Golden Joystick Awards, Best
        Narrative at the 2017 Game Developers Choice Awards and Debut Game at
        the 2017 British Academy Games Awards. By late 2016, the game had sold
        over a million copies. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur

      <h2>Development and release</h2>
      <p>
        Firewatch is the first video game from Campo Santo and was created by
        Jake Rodkin and Sean Vanaman, who were the creative leads on The Walking
        Dead; Nels Anderson, the lead designer of Mark of the Ninja; and artist
        Olly Moss.[8] Chris Remo was involved in many aspects of the design and
        also composed the score.<br />
        <br />
        Development for Firewatch began with a single painting by Moss.[2] Jane
        Ng, lead environmental artist at Campo Santo, was tasked with
        translating Moss' work into 3D environments while maintaining his
        stylized artistic vision.[2] Moss, who had previously been known
        primarily for his graphic design work, had joined Vanaman and Rodkin to
        found Campo Santo after spending many years working on the periphery of
        game development.[10] In creating the painting, Moss emulated National
        Park Service posters from the New Deal era in both color palette and
        iconography.<br />
        <br />
        The development team went on a camping trip to Yosemite National Park
        for inspiration for the game,[12] where they visited a lookout tower
        built with the same design as its video game counterpart.[13] Further
        inspiration for the game came from Vanaman and Anderson's experiences
        growing up in rural Wyoming.<br />
        <br />Firewatch runs on the Unity game engine.[14] Ng disapproved of the
        tools for creating trees and therefore hand-modeled the 23 kinds of
        trees that would be placed within the game 4,600 times. A custom shader
        was also employed to produce more stylized and simplified foliage.[15]
        The in-game fire lookout towers were built in accordance with government
        specifications, utilizing standard lumber size, after Ng's first attempt
        was unsatisfactory.[16]
